## Principle/Techniques for creating and working with repos
<lo>
	<li>Create readme files, this makes it easier for people to understand and navigate your work as they may have a different system when compared to how you do your work. It is recommended to have one readme file for each repository</li>
	<li>Forking is best suited for when people want to contribute while they are unaffiliated with the project and it's team.</li>
	<li>Have three branches at all times, one being the main branch that will be released, another being the staging branch which is to check if code that is developed works after initial tests and the last one bing the development branch which is where code goes into and is initially tested before going to staging.</li>
</lo>


## Principles/Techniques for creating and working with branches
<lo>
	<li>Use branching when experimenting and don't put it in the development branch, having experimental code may break everything and even though its only in the development branch it still could affect the flow of work.</li>
	<li>Branches should be named according to what they are, for experimental branches they should be named after what is being experimented with.</li>
	<li>Limit branches to the people inside the project and who are affiliated to it, don't allow access someone who isn't affiliated with it.</li>
</lo>
