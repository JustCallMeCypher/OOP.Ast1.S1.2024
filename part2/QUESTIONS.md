	<li>Git, Subversion, Mercurial </li><br><br>
	<li>Some of Git's main advantages are the branches, ease of use when it comes to merge conflicts
	and it's ability to make collaborative efforts easier than it could have been.</li><br><br>
	<li>Branch, when it comes to git a branch is a line of development, branches can be created for 
	many reasons, for example, when making a big faeture for a game it would be a good idea to create a new 
	branch incase a lot of bugs come with it.<br><br>
	Pull, git pull is used to download content from a online repository.<br><br>
	Push, git push is used to upload content from a local repository to an online one, similar to saving 
	something to the cloud, it's the opposite of git pull. <br><br>
	Repository, a git repository is storage of content/project, it allows versions of the project to be <br>
	saved and accessed. <br><br>
	Working copy, a working copy of a project is one that runs as intended and without issue. <br><br>
	Merge, a merge is when two branches from a git project and merged together to form one branch.</li><br><br>
	<li>Creation software or adding features to one probably has policies about how the content of
	the software is saved during development. When Implementing features to the main version policies 
	are probably in place to limit who can change the main code.</li><br><br>
	<li>Github desktop and visual studio code are some tools that can help with merge conflicts with 
	them both outlining what is the merge conflict and helping with resolving the merge conflict.</li><br><br>
	<li>When a merging conflict occurs between two files the merge is ceased and a error is given to 
	the user, once the merge conflict is resolved by the user they will have to try the merge again, 
	if successful then it will proceed as normal.</li><br><br>
	<li>When a merge conflict appears git will edit the files with the merge conflict to help with 
	choosing which version of the file you want, this is done by having both versions of the conflict
	in the file of where it's happened to help streamline the process.</li><br><br>
	<li>The git revert command gets git to take the changes from the last commit and undo them and 
	turn it into a new commit.</li><br><br>
	<li>Git reset is a complex command with multiple ways of execution, these being "--hard", 
	"--mixed" and "--soft", with each state's function based on git's management system. </li><br><br>
	<li>Git revert can be seen as it's version of something like ctrl z, but instead of flat out removing
	the changes it figures out a way to undo the changes from the last commit in the project's history.<br><br>
	Git reset on the other hand is more complex yet versatile, with it's three forms of use, and although 
	it has three forms of use it is considered to be more dangerous to use when compared to git reset.</li><br><br>
	<li>False.</li><br><br>
	<li>True.</li><br><br>
	<li>DevOps is a software development cycle that combines both development and operations in in the
	 effort to get an increase in the efficiency, speed and security of the software being developed. This 
	 makes it a more nimble approach to a software development cycle when compared to others as a result.</li><br><br>
	<li>Github, makes it quicker and easier to code and upload code to a database for a software, this also
	helps quicken the pace at which others access it.<br><br>
	Jira Software can help with planning the project as it has multiple features that can be utilised as
	dedicated planning tools.<br><br>
	GetFeedback can be used to allow consumers to give feedback about the product which can be used to help
	with improving the software.</li><br><br>
	<li>CI/CD is short for continuous integration and continuous deployment/delivery, this cycle aims to 
	accelerate the development cycle with continuous integration meaning frequently integrating code into
	a shared repo while continuous deployment/delivery means frequent releases.</li><br><br>
